# Machine-Learning-Project
In the Supervised Learing folder, I’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
In the Unsupervised Learning folder, I’ll use my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
